# react-framework-scratch

A simple React framework for understanding how to build a React framework from scratch. And I also want to build it has better performance than Next.js.

> Next.js is the most convenient React framework, but it is getting slower as the project grows. So I want to build a React framework that is faster than Next.js.

It will support the following features:

- [x] Server-side rendering
- [ ] React Server Components
- [ ] File-based routing
- [ ] Image optimization
- [ ] Some of plugin system? (maybe)
- ...
