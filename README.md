# react-framework-scratch

A simple React framework for understanding how to build a React framework from scratch. And I also want to build it has a good readability for everyone to understand how react framework works.

It will support the following features:

- [x] Server-side rendering
- [x] React Server Components
- [ ] File-based routing
- [ ] Image optimization
- [ ] Some of plugin system? (maybe)
- [ ] ...

## Usage

### Install

```bash
pnpm install
```

You can also use `npm` to install the dependencies.

### Run the SSR server

```bash
pnpm serve
```

It will automatically build the project and start the SSR server.
